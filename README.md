[**PallyPower**](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/pally-power) [![CurseForge](https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/short_18911.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/pally-power) developed by **aznamir**<br/>
This add-on provides an interactive and easy to use interface that allows you to set your own blessings (Righteous Fury, Aura, Seal and Blessings) and automatically checks for missing buffs with an easy to read indicator. While in a Party or RAID Pally Power can be used to assign blessings to other Paladins. Fellow Paladins will also have to run Pally Power for this to occur and the Paladin doing the assignments will have to be the Party Leader, Raid Leader or Raid Assistant. Fellow Paladins can select the "Free Assignment" setting to allow other non-leaders to change your Blessing assignment. In combat, none of the assignments can be changed due to the in-combat lock-out.<br/>

------------------------------------------------

**This version of PallyPower for WoW 3.3.5a introduces several new features:** <br/>

**New Options:**<br/>

- **Auto-Hide Player Buttons**: New option to automatically hide player buttons after a set time, optimizing UI space.<br/>
- **Class Buttons in Class Colors**: New option to display class buttons now in respective class colors, enhancing visual clarity.<br/>
- **Flash Effect in Instances**: New option to add a flash effect to highlight players without buffs in instanced content (Arena, BG, Raid, Dungeon).<br/>
- **Player Button Names in Class Colors**: New option to display player buttons names now in respective class colors, enhancing visual clarity.<br/>

**Hotfixes:**<br/>

- **In-Combat Class Buff Button**: Added functionality that enables players to click the class buff buttons during combat.<br/>
A designated player for each class will be determined before combat, if the player/s are in range and alive they will receive the buff/s while combat now, otherwise you'll still need to use the Player Buttons.<br/>

**Dynamic Support for Vanilla, TBC and WOTLK:**<br/>

- **Realm Based Support**: The AddOn will work with Vanilla and TBC servers using the 3.3.5a client. If the server you are playing on is not supported then [open an issue](https://github.com/NoM0Re/PallyPower-Improved-3.3.5/issues) stating the server, realm and the expansion it's based on.

# **Installation:**
**IMPORTANT: If you have used a different PallyPower before or are updating this version from v3.2.20 to v3.2.21 and have profiles that you wish to save, backup your WTF folder. We must do a clean install, otherwise the AddOn will not work! You can perform a clean installation with the following steps:**
1. In your AddOns folder *(Interface/AddOns)* select the PallyPower folder and **delete** it.
2. In your SavedVariables folder *(WTF/Account/[AccountName]/SavedVariables)* select every PallyPower file *(everything that starts with PallyPower)* and **delete** them. **THIS STEP WILL REMOVE YOUR PALLYPOWER CONFIGURATIONS/PROFILES!**

*If you are unsure whether you have a clean install then do the above steps just to check!*

**Now we can do the regular installation:**
1. [Download here](https://github.com/NoM0Re/PallyPower-Improved-3.3.5/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Unzip and take folder **PallyPower** (not the PallyPower-Improved-3.3.5-main).
3. Put it in your WoW/Interface/AddOns folder.<br/>
